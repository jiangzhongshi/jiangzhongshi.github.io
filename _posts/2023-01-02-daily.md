# 2023 New Blog 

## New Blog
* Set up this blog site today, following the instruction here https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html
* Trying to jot something I learn everyday. Initially the text would be quite rough, hope the themes might converge a bit in the future


## Skateboard vs Snowboard
* Got some mileage on the snowboard, trying to get a lower cost way of practicing through skateboard.
* They turns out to be quite different.
* But balancing skills might carry, and in more advanced days, tricks are similar
* Skateboard, might start with some pushing practice and see if it can be made as a walking-substitute for shorter distance errands.
